# First Terrform Project #

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to provision, manage, and automate infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using declarative configuration files. Instead of manually creating resources in platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, Terraform lets you define your entire environment in code, enabling version control, repeatability, and scalability. It uses a state file to track real-world infrastructure and compares it against your configuration so it can safely create, update, or destroy resources as needed. This approach ensures consistent deployments, reduces human error, and makes infrastructure easier to test, share, and automate across teams.
